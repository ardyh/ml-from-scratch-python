# ml-from-scratch-python

A campus project of me and my 3 teammates:
- @alimutaw12
- @Dandi99
- @harymunli

of implementing supervised learning algorithms from scratch, in Python

[Tubes 1B Folder](/tubes-1b) contains my team's work on Decision Tree algorithm. We applied the ID3 and C4.5 variation

[Tubes 1C Folder](/tubes-1c) contains my team's work on Perceptron algorithm

[Tubes 1D Folder](/tubes-1d) contains my team's work on applying cross validation to evaluate our model's performance

[Tubes 2A Folder](/tubes-2a) contains my team's work on K-Means Clustering and Agglomerative Clustering algorithm
